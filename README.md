w.i.p. octool written in rust  

 Going to rewrite OC-tool in Rust instead of D. I like the looks of D, but too many libraries have been abandoned.  Going back to Rust.  

 If you're looking for the currently working OC-tool, [this may be the link you are looking for](https://github.com/rusty-bits/OC-tool).
